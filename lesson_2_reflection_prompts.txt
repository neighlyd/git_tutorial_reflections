What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  # git creates a .git directory containing meta-data about the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  # the staging area is a holding container for files before their changes are committed. Its value is that it enables you to bundle changes with comments, as well as append additional meta-data to those commits such as commiter name and date.
