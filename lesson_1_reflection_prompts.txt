How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Enabled me to spot the difference quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would enable me to not only spot differences between builds quickly, but would also enable me to pull old code into new, unrelated projects quickly and efficiently.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You don't accidentally override working code with test code, especially before you are finished coding elements.
    Cons: You may accidentally forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I imagine it has to do with whether its an auto-save or a commit maybe.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
