When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  # When you are collaborating, working on multiple computers, or simply wish to have data-redundancy for security purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  # Because automatically pulling changes might override work that you are currently doing on the local version of your repository.
