git log
  # gives a log of all commits for a particular repository. Useful for obtaining commit_id for each version.

git log --stat
  # gives a comparative log showing the stats of changes made in commits for a particular repository, such as how many additions or deletions there were.

git log --graph --oneline <branch_1> <branch_2>
  # Gives visualization of branch structure.

git diff <old_version_commit_id> <new_version_commit_id>
  # shows line-item differences between commits for a particular repository
  # without arguments compares <working_directory> and <staging_area>
  # git diff --staged compares the <staging_area> with the <most_recent_commit_id>

git checkout <old_version_commit_id>
  # access code from earlier commits
  # git checkout -b <branch_name> is equivalent to git branch <branch_name> followed by git checkout <branch_name>

git init
  # creates a new git repository

git status
  # gives information about git status of current directory, including where you are in the branch and when your last commit was.
  # untracked = uncommitted files

git add
  # adds a file to the staging area where files are bundled before commit.
  # The staging area is a copy of the most recent commit until you manually add new versions of files to it.

git commit
  # commits changes in staging area [via git add] to the git repository. Upon execution, it launches an editor to insert comments [using your preferred editor]. The best practices for git commit comments are located at - http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/

git reset --hard
  # removes ANY CHANGES to files in both <working_area> and <staging_area>
  # BE VERY CAREFUL, THIS IS AN IRREVERSABLE ACTION
  # Good idea to run git diff and git diff --staged before running.

########## BRANCHES #############

# Git allows you to create labels for commits
  # Master is the best-practice label for the main branch of a project.
  # DETACHED HEAD - means that you are looking at a branch that has no label.

git branch
  # No argument = shows branches
  # argument = label for new branch.
  # Asterix = current checked-out branch.
  # use git checkout <label> to switch between branches.

git branch -d <label>
  # deletes the <label> for a branch, not the commits itself. If branches have been merged, their commits will be interwoven. If not merged, these commits will be lost (unless you know the commit_id of the branch). Will be permanently lost when garbage collection runs.

git gc
  # runs garbage collection manually. This removes unreachable branches.

git merge <branch_1> <branch_2>
  # merges branches.
  # checkout desired main branch (<branch_1>)

git show <commit_id>
  # shows diff between <commit_id> and its parent. Useful in branched structure.

  ########## GitHub Integration #############

git remote
  # No Arguments: gives a list of current remote repositories.

git remote add <local_label> <github_url>
  # Adds the remote repository to your repository store.
  # Best Practice: if you only have one repository, name it "origin"

git remote -v
  # gives a verbose list of remote github repositories, including URLs.
